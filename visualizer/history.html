            <h1>History of Biblical Canon</h1>
            <p>Why Some Books Are Recognized and Others Aren't</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Formation of Biblical Canon</h2>
            <p>The books we call "The Bible" today weren't always collected together. Over centuries, different Jewish and Christian communities made decisions about which texts were authoritative scripture. These decisions were influenced by tradition, theology, politics, and practical considerations.</p>

            <p>Understanding this history helps explain why different traditions (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Ethiopian) have different numbers of books in their Bibles today.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Protestant Canon -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Protestant Canon (66 Books)</h2>

            <h3>Old Testament (39 Books)</h3>
            <p>The Protestant Old Testament follows the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), which was largely settled by Jewish rabbis at the Council of Jamnia around 90 AD. However, debate continued for centuries about books like Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, and Esther.</p>

            <h3>New Testament (27 Books)</h3>
            <p>The New Testament canon developed over the first four centuries of Christianity. Early church fathers quoted various texts, but consensus emerged gradually.</p>

        <!-- Council of Nicea Myth -->
        <div class="content-section" style="border-left-color: #ff4444;">
            <h2>Common Myth: The Council of Nicea Chose the Bible</h2>

            <p><strong style="color: #ff4444;">This is FALSE.</strong> One of the most persistent myths about the Bible is that Emperor Constantine and the Council of Nicea (325 AD) decided which books would be in the New Testament. This claim, popularized by fiction like "The Da Vinci Code," has no historical basis.</p>

            <h3>What the Council of Nicea Actually Did</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Addressed the Arian Controversy:</strong> The main purpose was to settle whether Jesus was divine or created (Arianism). The Council affirmed Christ's full divinity.</li>
                <li><strong>Created the Nicene Creed:</strong> The famous statement of Christian belief ("We believe in one God...")</li>
                <li><strong>Set the Date of Easter:</strong> Standardized when Christians would celebrate the resurrection</li>
                <li><strong>Addressed Church Governance:</strong> Rules about bishops, clergy ordination, and church organization</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Nicea Did NOT Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Did NOT vote on which books to include in the Bible</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Did NOT "suppress" alternative gospels</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Did NOT discuss the biblical canon at all</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The claim that the Council of Nicea chose the books of the Bible is a modern myth with no ancient support. The New Testament canon was already largely established through church usage long before 325 AD."
                <div class="source">- Bart Ehrman, New Testament Scholar</div>
            </div>

            <h3>When Was the Canon Actually Decided?</h3>
            <p>The 27-book New Testament was first officially listed by <strong>Athanasius in 367 AD</strong> (42 years AFTER Nicea) and confirmed by regional councils at <strong>Hippo (393 AD)</strong> and <strong>Carthage (397 AD)</strong>. Even then, these councils recognized books that were already widely used - they didn't create a new list from scratch.</p>

            <p>The canon emerged organically through centuries of church use, not through a single dramatic vote. Books that were read in churches, quoted by respected teachers, and considered apostolic in origin gradually became "canonical."</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Roman Catholic Canon -->
        <div class="content-section" style="border-left-color: #9370DB;">
            <h2>Roman Catholic Bible (73 Books)</h2>

            <p>The Roman Catholic Bible contains <strong>73 books</strong> - the same 66 books as Protestant Bibles plus 7 additional books called the Deuterocanonical books (or "Apocrypha" by Protestants). These additional books are: Tobit, Judith, 1 & 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), and Baruch (including the Letter of Jeremiah).</p>

            </div>

            <h3>The Role of the Pope and Church Authority</h3>
            <p>Catholic doctrine holds that the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit and led by the Pope, has the authority to definitively determine which books belong in Scripture. Key points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Papal Authority:</strong> Pope Damasus I (382 AD) was the first to issue an authoritative list matching the current Catholic canon</li>
                <li><strong>Church as Interpreter:</strong> Catholics believe the Church that produced and collected the Scriptures has authority to define which books are inspired</li>
                <li><strong>Infallibility:</strong> The Council of Trent's declaration on the canon is considered an infallible, irreformable teaching</li>
                <li><strong>Sacred Tradition:</strong> The canon is based on Sacred Tradition alongside Scripture - what the Church has always taught and used</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The most sacred Council of Trent... following the example of the orthodox Fathers, receives and venerates all the books of the Old and New Testaments... and also traditions pertaining to faith and conduct... with equal devotion and reverence."
                <div class="source">- Council of Trent, Session 4 (1546)</div>
            </div>

            <h3>Why 73 Books Instead of 66?</h3>
            <p>The Catholic Church argues that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apostolic Usage:</strong> The early Church used the Greek Septuagint (which included these books) as its Old Testament</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent Tradition:</strong> These books were read in churches and quoted by Church Fathers for 1,500 years before Luther</li>
                <li><strong>New Testament References:</strong> Several NT passages seem to allude to deuterocanonical books (Hebrews 11:35 → 2 Maccabees 7; James 1:19 → Sirach 5:11)</li>
                <li><strong>Original Christian Bible:</strong> The Vulgate (Latin Bible) translated by St. Jerome in 405 AD included these books, and was the standard Bible for over 1,000 years</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Protestant Reformation Response</h3>
            <p>Martin Luther (1534) removed the deuterocanonical books from the Old Testament, placing them in a separate section called "Apocrypha" - useful for reading but not for establishing doctrine. His reasons included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No Hebrew originals existed (he thought - some were later found in the Dead Sea Scrolls)</li>
                <li>Jews did not accept them in their canon</li>
                <li>Doctrinal concerns: 2 Maccabees 12:46 supports prayers for the dead, which seemed to support purgatory</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other Protestant reformers followed Luther, and eventually these books were removed entirely from most Protestant Bibles by the 19th century.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Deuterocanonical -->
        <div class="content-section deutero">
            <h2>Deuterocanonical / Apocrypha (14 Books)</h2>

            <p>These books were included in the Greek Septuagint (LXX), the Bible of most early Christians. They were quoted by Church Fathers and included in early Christian Bibles. The Catholic and Orthodox churches consider them canonical.</p>

            <h3>Why They Were Excluded by Protestants</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Hebrew Original:</strong> Most were written in Greek, not Hebrew (though some like Sirach had Hebrew versions)</li>
                <li><strong>Jewish Rejection:</strong> The Pharisaic tradition at Jamnia excluded them</li>
                <li><strong>Reformation Theology:</strong> Luther and other reformers questioned doctrines like purgatory (2 Maccabees 12:46) and prayers for the dead</li>
                <li><strong>Jerome's Influence:</strong> Though he translated them, Jerome called them "apocrypha" (hidden)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why They're Included by Catholics/Orthodox</h3>
            <ul>

        <!-- Ethiopian Canon -->
        <div class="content-section ethiopian">
            <h2>Ethiopian Orthodox Canon (81-88 Books)</h2>

            <p>The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has the largest biblical canon of any Christian tradition. Their canon includes books preserved nowhere else, reflecting their ancient and independent Christian tradition dating to the 4th century.</p>

            <h3>Unique Ethiopian Books</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 Enoch:</strong> Quoted in Jude 14-15, preserved completely only in Ge'ez (Ethiopian)</li>
                <li><strong>Jubilees:</strong> Retells Genesis-Exodus with emphasis on calendar and angels</li>
                <li><strong>4 Baruch:</strong> Continuation of Jeremiah's story</li>
                <li><strong>Broader Maccabees:</strong> Includes 1-3 Maccabees and additional texts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Ethiopia Preserved More</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Christianity:</strong> Ethiopian Church tradition claims founding by the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8)</li>
                <li><strong>Geographic Isolation:</strong> Mountain kingdom preserved texts lost elsewhere</li>
                <li><strong>Independent Development:</strong> Not subject to later Western or Byzantine canon decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Jewish Roots:</strong> Strong Jewish influence from ancient times (Queen of Sheba tradition)</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Dead Sea Scrolls -->
        <div class="content-section dss">
            <h2>Dead Sea Scrolls (Discovered 1947-1956)</h2>

            <p>The Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves near Qumran, revolutionized our understanding of Second Temple Judaism. They include the oldest known biblical manuscripts plus texts from a Jewish sect (likely Essenes).</p>

            <h3>What Was Found</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biblical Texts:</strong> Every OT book except Esther (some in multiple copies)</li>
                <li><strong>Sectarian Documents:</strong> Community Rule, War Scroll, Temple Scroll</li>
                <li><strong>Apocrypha:</strong> Copies of Tobit, Sirach, 1 Enoch, Jubilees</li>
                <li><strong>Unique Texts:</strong> Pesharim (commentaries), liturgical texts, Genesis Apocryphon</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Significance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Textual Witness:</strong> 1,000 years older than previous Hebrew manuscripts</li>
                <li><strong>Canon Fluidity:</strong> Shows no fixed canon existed in this period</li>
                <li><strong>1 Enoch's Importance:</strong> Multiple copies suggest high regard for this text</li>
                <li><strong>Messianic Expectations:</strong> Illuminate the world of early Christianity</li>

            <h2>Gnostic & Early Christian Writings (22+ Texts)</h2>

            <p>These texts, many discovered at Nag Hammadi in 1945, represent alternative early Christian movements. They were rejected by the mainstream church but provide valuable historical insight.</p>

            <h3>Why They Were Rejected</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Late Date:</strong> Most written 2nd-4th century, after apostolic age</li>
                <li><strong>Theological Divergence:</strong> Gnostic dualism, docetism (Jesus only seemed human)</li>
                <li><strong>Pseudonymity:</strong> Falsely attributed to apostles (Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Philip)</li>
                <li><strong>Secret Knowledge:</strong> Claimed hidden teachings not for all believers</li>
                <li><strong>Church Consensus:</strong> Rejected by councils and church fathers</li>

            <h3>Why They Matter</h3>

        <!-- Gospel of Judas -->
        <div class="content-section" style="border-left-color: #ff4444;">
            <h2>The Gospel of Judas: A Case Study in Fraud</h2>

            <p>The Gospel of Judas gained worldwide attention when National Geographic published it in 2006, claiming it "rehabilitated" Judas as Jesus' most trusted disciple who betrayed him at Jesus' own request. This sensationalized narrative was <strong style="color: #ff4444;">largely fabricated</strong> through mistranslation and media hype.</p>

            <h3>What the Media Claimed</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Judas was a hero":</strong> He alone understood Jesus' true mission</li>
                <li><strong>"Jesus asked to be betrayed":</strong> Judas helped Jesus escape his physical body</li>
                <li><strong>"Christianity got it wrong":</strong> The church suppressed the "true" story</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why It's Fraudulent</h3>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="date">Translation Errors</div>
                <div class="event">April DeConick (Rice University) and other Coptic scholars found National Geographic's translation contained <strong>critical errors</strong>. The text actually calls Judas a "daimon" (demon), not a "spirit." The phrase translated as "you will exceed them all" actually reads "you will do <em>worse</em> than them all." Judas is portrayed negatively, not positively.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="date">Rushed Publication</div>
                <div class="event">National Geographic rushed to publish before Easter 2006 for maximum publicity. Scholars were given limited access and pressured to meet media deadlines. Peer review was bypassed. The sensational interpretation served commercial interests.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="date">Gnostic Context Ignored</div>
                <div class="event">In Sethian Gnosticism, Judas serves the evil creator god (demiurge), not the true God. The text is actually <strong>mocking</strong> Judas and the other apostles as servants of a false deity. This theological context was ignored to create a better headline.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="date">2nd Century Forgery</div>
                <div class="event">Written around 150-180 AD in Egypt, at least 100+ years after Judas died. Attributed to Judas to give it false authority. Irenaeus condemned it as heretical in 180 AD - early Christians already knew it was fake.</div>
            </div>

            <h3>The Real Gospel of Judas</h3>
            <p>When properly translated, the Gospel of Judas is a <strong>Sethian Gnostic polemic</strong> that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attacks orthodox Christianity:</strong> Mocks apostolic succession and church practices</li>
                <li><strong>Condemns Judas:</strong> He serves the evil archons, not the true God</li>
                <li><strong>Promotes Gnostic cosmology:</strong> Complex hierarchy of aeons, archons, and the demiurge</li>
                <li><strong>Denies bodily resurrection:</strong> True salvation is escape from the material world</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The National Geographic translation was seriously wrong in many places... Judas is not a hero in this text. He is a tragic figure who serves the lower cosmic powers."
                <div class="source">- April DeConick, Professor of Biblical Studies, Rice University</div>
            </div>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Media Sensationalism:</strong> "Christianity was wrong!" sells better than accurate scholarship</li>
                <li><strong>Rushed Scholarship:</strong> Commercial deadlines should never override peer review</li>
                <li><strong>Context Matters:</strong> Ancient texts must be read within their theological and cultural frameworks</li>
                <li><strong>Original Languages:</strong> Coptic is difficult - always wait for multiple scholarly translations</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background: rgba(255, 68, 68, 0.15); border-radius: 8px;">
                <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> The Gospel of Judas is a genuine 2nd-century Gnostic text, but the "heroic Judas" narrative was a modern fabrication based on mistranslation and media spin. It tells us nothing reliable about the historical Judas or Jesus.

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

            <p>Understanding canon history doesn't undermine faith - it enriches it. The Bible we have today emerged through centuries of careful discernment by communities of faith. Different traditions made different decisions, each with reasons rooted in theology and tradition.</p>

            <p>PROJECT 159 exists to explore these connections and let you see how all 159 books - canonical, deuterocanonical, pseudepigraphal, and apocryphal - relate to each other through cross-references. The story of scripture is bigger than any single tradition.</p>
